### Code Generation
- Always explain architectural decisions
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous
- Suggest improvements but don't implement without approval
- Generate complete, working code blocks (no placeholders)

### Problem Solving
- Start with the simplest solution that works
- Only add complexity when specifically requested
- Highlight potential issues or edge cases
- Suggest testing approaches for new features

### Communication
- Use clear, structured explanations
- Provide code comments in generated files
- Flag when you're making assumptions
- Offer alternatives when multiple approaches exist
